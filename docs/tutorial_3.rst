Tutorial: Writing Your Own Widgets
==================================

Writing your own widgets is the most complex thing you're likely to do in PyOpticon. We've tried to 
make it relatively straightforward. It's worth it, since once you're not bound to the library of existing 
widgets, you'll be free to build dashboards to control all kinds of existing and newly-acquired devices in 
your own lab or workspace. 

PyOpticon's Architecture
**********************************

Before we go into how to create widgets, we wanted to give a quick overview of what's actually going on inside 
a PyOpticon dashboard. The dashboard is an object containing various graphical and functional elements, including 
dictionaries of the constituent widgets that make it up. Running a dashboard entails launching a number of threads, 
each executing tasks in 
parallel. One 'main' thread runs the Dashboard object, operates the graphical user userface, and prompts other threads to do 
things. This all takes place in a single thread because Tkinter, the graphics package we use, is generally not 
thread-safe. All of the other threads each communicate with a single device. Since serial communications are very amenable 
to being split amongst multiple threads, giving each device its own thread works great; we just have to be a little 
careful about how those threads go about updating their associated graphical fields.

Here is a graphical finite-state-machine representation of what the main thread is doing:

.. image:: img/all_fsm.png
    :alt: A state machine of the main thread.

This isn't super important to study in detail. While it's one thread, the serial widget, logging widget, automation widget, 
and interlock polling routine are all mostly doing their own things. Not pictured are a bunch of background processes 
within the Tkinter package that actually draw and operate the graphical interface (e.g., animating when you click a button, or 
showing dropdown when a menu is clicked on).

Each widget's actions when prompted to connect, update, or disconnect are executed in the widget's thread. These are discussed 
further below, and a graphical finite state machine for an individual widget is shown.

Extending the GenericWidget Class
**********************************

Basics
''''''''

The ``GenericWidget`` class is meant to allow widget development with less tedium and with less knowledge of tkinter, 
Pyserial, and other specialized libraries. This is done by defining a superclass (``GenericWidget``) from which subclasses 
(e.g., ``Valco2WayValveWidget``) are defined. If you haven't worked much with object-oriented programming before, it's 
probably worth reading a primer elsewhere (like this_) on classes, objects, and inheritance. In short, the code that all 
widgets share is written in a superclass, and when writing a subclass you need only write the code that is unique to the 
widget that you're trying to create. 

.. _this: https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#how-do-you-define-a-class-in-python 

We recommend using ``GenericWidget`` as the superclass for all widgets representing physical devices, and in fact for 
all widgets except for purely cosmetic ones. 
A later section talks about ``MinimalWidget``, which lets you build widgets completely from scratch, which 
we only recommend if you're making a purely cosmetic widget like a ``TitleWidget``, or if you need really special 
behavior and you really know what you're doing.

We'll run through an example of building the Valco 2 Way Valve widget from the ``majumdar_lab_widgets`` package. This is a 
convenient example because it's only got one output field (the valve's actual position) and one user input field (the desired 
valve position). An important first step is to know this device's serial communication protocol. We'll assume we know the protocol 
for the valve already, but if we didn't, the next section includes tips on how to find it.

GenericWidget Input/Output Fields
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The properties of ``GenericWidget`` subclasses are mostly stored as what PyOpticon refers to as 'fields'. A field is a 
text variable with a text identifier, a corresponding graphical element, and a label. For example, in the 
``Valco2WayValveWidget`` class, there's a field for 'Position Selection' corresponding to a dropdown menu 
and there's a field for 'Actual Position' corresponding to a text readout. Fields are created using the ``add_field`` 
method, read using the ``get_field`` method, and set using the ``set_field`` method, all of which are described in the 
documentation. The point of using PyOpticon fields rather than instance variables is to let you avoid messing with 
tkinter GUI elements and StringVar objects, 
provide a clean way for automation scripts to control widgets, and let you avoid manually defining a ``log_data`` 
function for most widgets.

GenericWidget Methods to Implement
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Here is a graphical respresentation of what a GenericWidget does:

.. image:: img/widget_fsm.png
    :alt: A state machine of an individual widget.

The overall state logic and the tasks in the light blue blocks are implemented for you in the GenericWidget superclass. 
The orange blocks represent methods that you can (and in some cases must) implement whenever you make a new widget, discussed in more detail here:

*   ``__init__``: Required. The constructor method. Defines the widget's fields and visual layout.
*   ``on_handshake``: Strongly recommended. Called when the dashboard begins polling devices. This method should initialize any non- ``serial.Serial`` 
    objects needed for communication, check that communication is proceeding as expected, and populate the widget's fields with 
    any initial values that are desired. If an exception is raised, the handshake is understood to have failed, and the device 
    will not be polled.
*   ``on_update``: Required. Called whenever it's time to update the widget. Usually this method will query the physical device for 
    the latest readings, wait to receive them, parse them, and then update the widget's output fields accordingly.
*   ``on_serial_close``: Strongly recommended. Called when the dashboard stops polling devices. The dashboard will automatically close any ``serial.Serial`` objects 
    that it opened, but this method can close down other device-communication objects and return output fields to some placeholder value.
*   ``on_failed_serial_open``: Optional. If the widget is initialized with ``use_serial==True`` and constructing the ``serial.Serial`` object 
    fails (e.g. because the COM port doesn't exist), this method is called. It can do things like set fields' values to "No Reading".
*   ``on_confirm``: Optional. If the widget has input fields, a confirm button will be autogenerated, and this method will be called when it 
    is clicked. Usually, its job is to parse the input fields' values and translate them into commands to be sent to the device via a serial connection.

Below, we've included the whole ``Valco2WayValveWidget`` implementation; reading that is probably the easiest way to 
understand what all these methods do. But first, here are a couple of important points:

*   If a widget is initialized with ``use_serial=True``, the dashboard will open a ``serial.Serial`` object for you 
    that gets stored in the widget's ``self.serial_object`` property. It will also worry about closing that object for you 
    when communication ends. For widgets that update themselves in some other way, e.g. using an OEM Python driver, you'll 
    need to take care of these things yourself.

*   The default behavior is to use ``on_update`` as the 
    ``on_handshake`` method, with the handshake considered to 
    have failed if ``on_update`` raises an exception. Basically, by default you can use a normal update cycle as a 
    handshake, but you have the option of having a 'special' handshake that happens the first time only. You might want to override 
    ``on_handshake`` if you want to initialize a special object to handle serial communications with the device, 
    query the device for values that only need to be checked once (e.g. a device ID), or set input fields' default values 
    to match the device's state at the moment you connect.

*   It's best to initialize most widget properties and graphical elements as PyOpticon fields. 
    Any PyOpticon fields can be read using ``get_field``, set using ``set_field``, 
    controlled in automation scripts using ``schedule_action``, and will be logged by default. If you just want 
    to store internal values that aren't logged or shown in the GUI, instance variables (e.g. ``self.some_value=19``) 
    work just fine.

*   The default behavior of ``log_data`` as defined in ``GenericWidget`` is usually fine, but you can override it if you need to 
    process the data before logging it or log data that aren't PyOpticon fields. It just needs to return a ``dict`` of the 
    names and values of the data to be logged at a given time step.

*   Some physical devices are finnicky about receiving too many serial queries in a row, and want a delay between 
    consecutive commands. Just put a ``time.sleep(0.05)`` or similar in between successive queries, messing with the time as needed. 
    Blocking code like this is OK because each device has its own thread.

With all that in mind, here's the implementation of ``Valco2WayValve``, with some of the comments adjusted from the source code 
for clarity and brevity. We just construct a widget, add an input and output field, and define how to send and parse serial 
communications with the valve.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import time
    from .. import generic_widget

    class Valco2WayValveWidget(generic_widget.GenericWidget):
        # Docstrings have been omitted to save space

        def __init__(self,parent_dashboard,name,nickname,default_serial_port,valve_positions,valve_id='1'):
            # Initialize the superclass with most of the widget functionality
            super().__init__(parent_dashboard,name,nickname,'#ADD8E6',default_serial_port=default_serial_port,baudrate=9600)
            # Record the valve id
            self.valve_id=valve_id.encode('ascii')
            # Add a dropdown field
            self.valve_positions=valve_positions
            self.add_field(field_type='dropdown', name='Position Selection',label='Selected Position: ',
                        default_value=self.valve_positions[0], log=True, options=self.valve_positions)
            # Add a readout field
            self.add_field(field_type='text output', name='Actual Position',
                        label='Actual Position: ', default_value='No Reading', log=True)
            # Move the confirm button
            self.move_confirm_button(row=3,column=2)

        def on_failed_serial_open(self,success):
            self.set_field('Actual Position','No Reading',hush_warning=True)

        def on_update(self):
            # Send the query
            if not self.parent_dashboard.offline_mode:
                self.get_serial_object().reset_input_buffer()
                to_write=self.valve_id+b'CP\r'
                self.get_serial_object().write(to_write)
            # Wait a bit
            time.sleep(0.2)
            # Read and parse the response
            if not self.parent_dashboard.offline_mode:
                status = str(self.serial_object.readline())
            else:
                v = np.random.randint(0,20)
                v = 'A' if v>10 else 'B'
                v = 'dd"'+str(v)+'dd\r\n'
                status = str(v.encode('ascii'))
            try:
                i = status.index("\"")+1
                is_A = status[i]=='A'
                if is_A:
                    self.set_field('Actual Position',self.valve_positions[0])
                else:
                    self.set_field('Actual Position',self.valve_positions[1])
            except Exception as e:
                fail_message=("Unexpected response received from 2-way valve: "+str(status))
                self.set_field('Actual Position','Read Error')
                return fail_message
            return True

        def on_serial_close(self):
            """When serial is closed, set all readouts to 'None'."""
            self.set_field('Actual Position','No Reading',hush_warning=True)

        def on_confirm(self):
            """When 'confirm' is pressed, send the appropriate commands to the valve.
            """
            selected = self.get_field('Position Selection')
            if not (selected in self.valve_positions):
                print("\"Confirm\" pressed with no/invalid option selected.")
                return
            choice = self.valve_positions.index(selected)
            if choice==0:
                print("Moving valve \""+self.name+"\" to \""+selected+"\" (A)")
                self.serial_object.write(self.valve_id+b'GOA\r')
            else:
                print("Moving valve \""+self.name+"\" to \""+selected+"\" (B)")
                self.serial_object.write(self.valve_id+b'GOB\r')


Here's what the widget ends up looking like:

Connecting to Instruments with Text-Based Serial Protocols
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Many instruments communicate with computers by receiving and sending binary-encoded text messages. By default, PyOpticon 
widgets use this type of communication, enabled by the pySerial Python package. 

In principle, a PyOpticon widget with pySerial can control any instrument that uses a text-based serial protocol. 
In practice, finding that protocol can be tricky. The protocol consists of a baud rate (an integer value, 
like 19200), a syntax for sending commands, and a syntax in which replies are sent.

It's easiest if you can find a manual for your device that contains its serial protocol. If that fails, often the 
manufacturer will have documentation on the serial protocol that they can send upon request. It may be referred to 
as an RS232, DB9, or serial protocol.

If you have a manufacturer-supplied program that can talk to the device, you can also try to listen in on its connection 
and reverse-engineer the serial protocol. Some programs that may help do this are portmon, com0com, and realterm. This works 
best for simple devices that send the same commands over and over. Trying to reverse-engineer the protocol for a complex 
instrument in this way would be quite hard.

To connect to an instrument, find the appropriate set of cables and converters. USB-to-RS232 converters are available 
on Amazon and tend to work pretty well. We've had some issues using USB-to-many-RS232 multiplexers -- it seems a bit 
more reliable to use a USB multiplexer coupled to many USB-to-RS232 cables. You can use the serial port scanner to verify 
that a new serial port appeared when the instrument was plugged in. Sometimes, you need to change settings on the instrument 
to enable serial communications; if so, the manual may explain how to do so.

Before trying to code a PyOpticon widget, we recommend sending the relevant commands manually to make sure the protocol works as 
expected. One easy way to do this is to use the pySerial library in the Python shell, accessed via IDLE. The pySerial 
website has some useful examples_.

On occasion, an instrument will require serial parameters like parity and stop bits that are different from the pySerial default. 
As a workaround, in ``on_handshake``, close the ``self.serial_object`` object that the widget auto-creates and replace it 
with a new ``serial.Serial`` instance with the correct parameters and the same serial port.

Connecting to Instruments with Other Python Serial Packages and OEM Drivers
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are various other serial communication standards besides RS232 with ASCII-encoded text. One example is the 
RS485 standard with the Modbus communication protocol, a system commonly used for industrial controls. Another is 
the VISA standard, which helps manufactuers create cross-platform drivers for there instruments. There are 
existing Python libraries to facilitate communications using many of these standards, such as minimalmodbus and pyvisa. 
Additionally, many instrument manufacturers provide Python drivers to interface with their instruments. 

The workflow to use one of these protocols is similar to that for 'plain' RS232 serial. First, write a standalone (non-PyOpticon) 
Python script that can read from and write to your instrument, ensuring that you understand how Python communicates with your 
instrument. Second, in ``on_handshake``, initialize whatever object represents your serial connection (e.g. a ``pymodbus.ModbusSerialClient`` object). 
Then, implement the other methods as normal, making sure to close the object however is needed in ``on_serial_close``. The built-in 
Thorlabs Optical Power Meter widget is a good example of a widget that uses an OEM Python driver.

Important Notes on Multithreading
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
PyOpticon uses multithreading to allow the use of blocking code in widget methods, which creates a good deal of flexibility in what types of widgets you can make.
Blocking code is code that stops a program thread from doing anything else 
until it executes. With non-blocking text-based pySerial communications, you can instantaneously write to the device, 
do other things elsewhere in the program, then check back later to see if there was a response. PyOpticon uses this to 
query many devices in parallel. However, a pymodbus query will block all other tasks for ~0.1s while it waits for an instrument to respond. 
The same is true of using most OEM drivers to query an instrument. 
Because each device has its own thread (and usually each widget, unless explicitly told to share a thread), 
blocking code in handshakes, updates, and confirms will generally not gum up the program. 
While one thread waits for a certain device to respond, other parts of the program can go about their tasks.

However, as a result of this architecture, there are two things that you need to be aware of:

*   A widget's ``on_handshake``, ``on_update``, and ``on_confirm`` need to interact with the widget, the Dashboard object, 
    and graphical interface objects in thread-safe ways. 
    Each of those methods executes in a widget's thread, while the Dashboard and graphical interface live in a different 
    thread, and blindly manipulating variables in one thread from another thread is a recipe for disaster. ``set_field`` and 
    ``get_field`` are written to be thread-safe, so you can use them without worrying. To give you more flexibility, we also 
    provide ``do_threadsafe``, which can be used like so: ``self.do_threadsafe(lambda: self.disable_field("Setpoint"))``.
*   To shut down widgets promptly, ``on_serial_close`` executes immediately in the main dashboard thread, unlike ``on_update`` etc. that 
    execute in the widgets' respective threads. One can have a situation where an ``on_update`` method queries a device then waits for a response, 
    but while it's waiting, ``on_serial_close`` is called serial connection closes, and it then attempts to read from a serial object that is closed. 
    Therefore, before reading or writing to serial, ``on_update`` and ``on_confirm`` should double-check that the serial 
    connection is still open by checking the widget's ``self.parent_dashboard.serial_connected`` flag. Calling ``set_field`` while 
    serial is closed prints a warning to help you remember to do this, though it can be suppressed by giving ``set_field`` the argument ``hush_warning=True``.

Be careful if you choose to take advantage of packages that offer asynchronous access to serial devices, e.g. OEM drivers 
that make use of asyncio. In many cases it's simplest to force the thread to wait until an asynchronous method finishes before 
moving to the next task, essentially turning it into blocking code. Since each widget gets its own thread, and you likely only need to do 
a handful of calls every update cycle, doing so is unlikely to gum up the entire dashboard. 

GenericWidget Tricks and Features
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In developing widgets for our own lab, there were a few things for which we added special options in the ``GenericWidget`` 
class. They're buried in the documentation, so we will quickly highlight some here:

*   Offline-mode testing: Sometimes it's nice to do a lot of the cosmetic setup of a widget on a laptop or at home, 
    with dummy values replacing values read from a physical device, then come 
    into lab just to do the final integration with the hardware. A dashboard can be initialized with ``offline_mode=True`` to 
    indicate this, which sets a dashboard's ``offline_mode`` flag for widgets to check. Then, in an ``on_update`` method, you can 
    say something like ``status = self.serial_object.readline() if not self.parent_dashboard.offline_mode else b'123C\n'``, and proceed 
    with parsing as though b'123\\n' were an actual response from a real device.
*   Disabling fields: If you want to grey out an input field, perhaps so you can't change it while the serial connection 
    is active, the ``disable_field`` and ``enable_field`` methods will let you do that.
*   Moving confirm button: If the 'Confirm' button is autogenerated in an inconvenient place, 
    you can move it using the ``move_confirm_button`` method.
*   Overriding colors: The ``override_color`` method lets you change the color of a widget's frame from the default for that type of widget.
*   Updating a widget less often: The optional ``update_every_n_cycles`` argument to the ``GenericWidget`` constructor creates a widget that updates every 
    2nd, 3rd, or nth cycle instead of every cycle. This is useful for instruments that take a while to respond to serial queries. 
    The ``SpicinessWidget`` class is initalized 
    with ``update_every_n_cycles=3`` to demonstrate this option.
*   Widgets sharing a thread: sometimes it may be necessary for multiple widgets to share one serial connection. This happened for us 
    when we have several mass flow controllers that are all controlled by one control box with a single serial connection. We added this 
    feature in a release and haven't tested it quite as thoroughly, so it's currently available in Github on the branch 'thread_sharing_enabled'.
    The main branch and the PyPI-hosted package currently don't support thread-sharing. We will merge the branch and update PyPI once 
    we've tested the new version some more.
    
    You can 
    initialize a GenericWidget with the parameter ``widget_to_share_thread_with`` and it will create a single thread for multiple widgets. 
    The thread maintains a queue of tasks, so you can be sure that the widgets' ``on_handshake``, ``on_update``, and ``on_serial_close`` methods will always
    be called in the same order (the order in which the widgets were added to the dashboard).


Extending the MinimalWidget Class
**********************************

For all widgets representing physical devices, we suggest extending the ``GenericWidget`` class, which saves a lot of work 
compared to building one from scratch. Even for widgets that don't represent a physical device, e.g. some kind of 
calculator widget to help the operator, it may be easiest to just use a ``GenericWidget`` subclass with the 
``use_serial=False`` option, which can save some messing with tkinter GUI elements. However, we include the ``MinimalWidget`` 
class in case you really do want to build a widget from scratch.

The ``MinimalWidget`` class implements only the few methods that are required for a widget to interface with its parent 
dashboard (``on_handshake``, ``on_update``, ``on_confirm``, and ``on_serial_close``). 
All of them default to doing nothing, though of course you can override them.

The most likely use of the ``MinimalWidget`` is writing a widget that is purely cosmetic. Such a widget needs none of the 
serial or logging machinery of a ``GenericWidget`` subclass, nor would it want to be stuck with a ``GenericWidget`` subclass' 
colored frame and gridded layout. A MinimalWidget class just contains a tkinter frame object on which anything can be drawn, 
e.g. text, images, etc. The only widget we've written that extends ``MinimalWidget`` is the ``TitleWidget``, whose entire 
implementation is included below: 

.. code-block:: python

    from tkinter import *
    import tkinter.font as tkFont
    from .. import minimal_widget

    class TitleWidget(minimal_widget.MinimalWidget):
        """ A simple widget containing only text, intended for making a big-text title for a dashboard. 
        Uses the MinimalWidget superclass, since all of the GenericWidget machinery is unnecessary.\n

        :param parent_dashboard: The dashboard object to which this device will be added
        :type parent_dashboard: pyopticon.dashboard.PyOpticonDashboard
        :param title: The text to be displayed within this widget, called 'title' because it's likely to be the title of the entire dashboard.
        :type title: str
        :param font_size: The size of font to be used in the text, as an integer.
        :type font_size: int
        """

        def __init__(self,parent_dashboard,title,font_size):
            """ Constructor for a title widget."""
            super().__init__(parent_dashboard)
            fontStyle = tkFont.Font(size=font_size)
            # This entire widget is just one big Label
            Label(self.frame, font = fontStyle, text = title).pack()
