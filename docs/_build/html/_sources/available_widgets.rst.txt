Widgets Made by PyOpticon Users
==========================================================================

It is our hope that PyOpticon users will share the widgets that they create so that others can use them. 
If an ecosystem of ready-made widgets develops for a variety of physical devices, the process of building a PyOpticon-powered experimental setup will be 
greatly streamlined, since a user can use a tried and tested widget rather than writing, debugging, and validating their own from scratch. 

This page will be used as a directory of widgets that PyOpticon users have written and shared with us, the developers. Currently, it is empty, and the 
only ready-made widgets available are those included in the built-in majumdar_lab_widgets package. We hope that will change.

We expect that users can just download 
the .py files containing the class definitions of the widgets they need and store them in a directory along with their dashboard .py files so that the dashboard 
can import them.

If you have a widget or set of widgets that you'd like to share, please email <rrandall@stanford.edu>. We can post a link on this page to a Github repo, Google Drive 
folder, or PyPI entry. We only ask that you make a reasonable effort to debug and validate your widget(s)'s performance in your usual use case. Provide clear information in a 
readme file or similar about the situations in which the widgets were tested and any known bugs or limits to their performance. Your code doesn't need to be gorgeous, but 
it would be nice if it were reasonably readable so that users may make an effort to debug things on their own if something goes awry.

Thanks for reading and we hope to hear from you about any widgets you develop!
